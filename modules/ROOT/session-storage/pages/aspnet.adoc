== What is a session store?

Web applications are session-oriented. When a user logs in to a site, for example, they start a "session". When the user logs out (or the session times out, more commonly), the session ends.

=== What is stored in session?

Any state that a user needs can be stored in session. It could be as minimal as the user's name. User preferences can also be stored in session: language, preferred retail location, invitation/coupon codes, and more.

=== Why do I need one?

Because HTTP is "stateless", a web application needs to store session-related data somewhere. By default, session data is usually stored in memory on the web server. However, if the web server goes down or is restarted, that session information is wiped out. To prevent this, session data can be stored elsewhere.

=== Session storage with web farms

Another reason to store session data elsewhere is because of web farms.

If session data is stored on the web server, then a single user can only interact with a single server. This is known as "sticky sessions".

Sticky sessions can be problematic, so using another location for data avoids the need for sticky sessions.

=== Why Couchbase is a good choice for a Session Store

Couchbase Server is an ideal choice for a session store.

* Performance: Couchbase Server has a memory-first architecture. Data can be retrieved with very low latency. This is important because session data is often retrieved on every page.

* Flexibility: Session data can vary a lot depeding on the needs of different parts of the web site.

* TTL: Data stored in Couchbase can be easily configured to expire after a set period of time with time-to-live (TTL).
